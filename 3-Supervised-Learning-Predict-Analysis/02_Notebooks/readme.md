# 🔍 Supervised Learning Classification Project
*A Machine Learning Pipeline for Predicting Class Labels*

This project demonstrates a complete **supervised learning classification workflow**, built using Python and structured for reuse, clarity, and portfolio presentation.
All analysis and experimentation originate from the main notebook:

📓 **`Climate_Change_Classification_Notebook.ipynb.ipynb`**

The project showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, evaluation, and visualization for classification tasks.

# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end unsupervised machine learning workflow focused on clustering, dimensionality reduction, and exploratory data analysis.  
The project is built from the `TeamCBB6Notebook.ipynb` notebook and structured for readability, reproducibility, and portfolio presentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Unsupervised learning is used to uncover hidden patterns in data without predefined labels.  
This project applies core techniques:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**
- **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
